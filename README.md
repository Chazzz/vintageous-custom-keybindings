custom keybindings for vintageous

Vintageous is advertised as not supporting remapped keybindings. This may be true, but it's not impossible! I have provided here a brief example of how I remapped two vintageous keys to two different keys.

If you have a more complicated setup which you would like to share (remapping capital letters, e.g.), send me a pull request!
